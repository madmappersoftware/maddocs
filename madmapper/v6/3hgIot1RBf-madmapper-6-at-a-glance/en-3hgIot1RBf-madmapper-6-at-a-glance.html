<h2 class="int-link-anchors">Discover MadMapper v6 Highlights</h2>
<p><em>(current infos and texts below from first MadMapper Beta 6 newsletter - November 2024)</em></p>
<h4>Timelines</h4>
<p>Take control of any parameter in a timely fashion! As simple as that. Bezier, Catmull Rom, Linear or not interpolated on the menu.</p>
<h4>Montage Tracks</h4>
<p class="p1">Create as many montage tracks as you like, as with non linear editing software. Cut, chop, arrange or time-reverse your medias the easy way. Before or once you&rsquo;ve crafted your montage track, simply assign it to the surface of your choice.</p>
<h4>Timelines grid</h4>
<p class="p1">Multiple timelines offer the flexibility to improvise by managing various sequences and switching between them to respond to the moment. Additionally, you can define a trigger exclusivity: either horizontally or vertically, even on the whole grid for mutually exclusive timelines.</p>
<h4>MAD conductor</h4>
<p class="p1">It's the conduct of your entire show ! Its dedicated view lets you organize your entire project, providing the info your need at your fingertips. Another MAD news: you can now manage and synchronize your entire show with Midi Time Code (MTC) or Linear Time Code (LTC).</p>
<h4>MAD clips</h4>
<p class="p1">MadMapper 6 also introduces Clips : short, repeatable, and loopable segments. These are ghostable and can be consolidated as unique elements as well. It's a great way to manipulate your content !</p>
<h4>Audio track</h4>
<p class="p1">Audio tracks come with advanced FFT analysis, offering powerful new options for audiovisual synchronization. It provides a visually stunning and practical way to see audio frequencies, making it easier than ever to place triggers with precision. A wonder for syncing visual elements to specific frequencies or beats !</p>
<h4>Markers</h4>
<p class="p1">Within your timeline tracks, you can set up markers with follow actions to bring basic logic and interactivity to your timelines. Wait for specific events such as button presses, custom goto to jump to specific parts of your show based on different actions and so on... Booya !</p>
<h4>Export</h4>
<p class="p1">Another game-changer: you can now bake your entire mapping, including Laser, DMX, Video, and Audio elements, all in one go! Whether it&rsquo;s your entire project or just a loop section, simply click the Export button in the top-right corner of the timeline and you'll get access to this export window including audio, video codecs settings, and more.</p>
<h4>DMX outputs</h4>
<p class="p1">DMX fixtures now sample directly within video surfaces ! Composite surfaces in realtime and convert your layer stack to light ! By default, this enables automatic DMX canvas generation, but for more accuracy you can also define a custom DMX canvas for pixel-perfect control. Plus you can create multiple canvas instances in the projectors tab.</p>
<h4>Projects workspaces</h4>
<p class="p1">We&rsquo;ve significantly enhanced project structure capabilities, now embedded in a local workspace. So you create a project, save it, and instead of having a .mad project, you now get a local workspace hosting your entire project. The workspace includes everything ! From materials and media to auto-saves, making it easier than ever to keep all project elements in one clean, accessible location. Collect and save your ressources from the File menu, then simply copy this entire folder to transfer your project to another computer !</p>
<h4>Offline library</h4>
<p class="p1">No more reliance on online materials and fx ! When you first start MadMapper, your entire library downloads directly to your computer, making it so much more convenient for offline work. The Library tab therefore hosts all your materials and fx, giving you quick access whether you're online or offline !</p>
<h4>Optimized UI</h4>
<p class="p1">One more standout change: the media pool is now conveniently positioned on the left, right beside the surfaces in order to put everything you need within easy reach. One trick though - if you prefer the previous layout, you can switch back via the View / Separate Media Tab menu. However keeping media on the left greatly improves comfort and workflow when using the timeline !</p>
