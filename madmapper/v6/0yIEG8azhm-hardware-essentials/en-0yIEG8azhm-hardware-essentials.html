<h2 class="int-link-anchors">Hardware Essentials</h2>
<p data-start="316" data-end="596">MadMapper is designed to be lightweight, flexible, and compatible with a wide range of hardware configurations.</p>
<p data-start="316" data-end="596">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="316" data-end="596">Whether you&rsquo;re working on a small projection mapping project or a large-scale installation, here&rsquo;s what you need to know about supported systems and recommended setups.</p>
<h3>What You Need to Run MadMapper</h3>
<p data-start="208" data-end="377">At its core, all you need to get started with <strong>MadMapper</strong> is a computer. Also meaning even with the Demo version you can explore the interface, design your mappings, and experiment with ideas entirely on-screen.</p>
<p data-start="208" data-end="377">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="208" data-end="377">If you plan to create&nbsp;<strong data-start="401" data-end="423">projection mapping</strong>, you'll need a projector. Most modern models will work; brightness, throw distance, and lens options simply depend on your project&rsquo;s scale. We break down the key considerations below.</p>
<p data-start="208" data-end="377">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="208" data-end="377">For <strong data-start="612" data-end="639">light and laser mapping</strong>, you&rsquo;ll find additional recommendations and best practices in the dedicated sections further down.</p>
<p data-start="208" data-end="377">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="208" data-end="377">And of course, be prepared with the usual essentials: video adapters, extension cables, power solutions, and other connectors depending on your setup.&nbsp;A well-organized toolkit goes a long way during live installations.</p>
<h3 data-start="316" data-end="596">Supported Platforms</h3>
<p data-start="631" data-end="693">MadMapper v6 runs seamlessly on both <strong data-start="665" data-end="674">macOS</strong> and <strong data-start="679" data-end="690">Windows</strong>.</p>
<div class="alert-banner-notes">
<p data-start="696" data-end="735"><strong data-start="696" data-end="705">macOS</strong>: version <strong data-start="715" data-end="733">10.9 or higher</strong></p>
<p data-start="738" data-end="775"><strong data-start="738" data-end="749">Windows</strong>: version <strong data-start="759" data-end="775">10 or higher</strong></p>
</div>
<p data-start="738" data-end="775">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="738" data-end="775">There is no &ldquo;better&rdquo; platform, both systems are fully supported and deliver excellent performance.</p>
<p data-start="738" data-end="775">The choice usually depends on your&nbsp;personal preference, budget, and the type of projects you plan to create.</p>
<h4 data-start="738" data-end="775">macOS Recommendations</h4>
<p data-start="1034" data-end="1153">MadMapper performs well even on modest Apple hardware, making it an excellent choice for portability and reliability.</p>
<ul data-start="1154" data-end="1533">
<li data-start="1154" data-end="1286">
<p data-start="1156" data-end="1286">Entry-level MacBooks (such as MacBook Air or older MacBook Pro models) are perfectly fine for comnon projection mapping tasks.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1287" data-end="1459">
<p data-start="1289" data-end="1459">If you plan to work extensively with heavy shaders, multiple video inputs,&nbsp;large 3D content, etc. you&rsquo;ll benefit from a&nbsp;more powerful GPU (graphics card).</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1460" data-end="1533">
<p data-start="1462" data-end="1533">Even a second-hand MacBook can be suitable for light to medium use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert-banner-tips">
<p>MadMapper has been a native M-software for Apple Silicon (M-series) computers since version 5 and above.</p>
</div>
<h4 data-start="1535" data-end="1732">Output considerations (macOS)</h4>
<p data-start="1535" data-end="1732">Modern MacBooks often feature limited video outputs (USB-C or Thunderbolt).</p>
<p data-start="1535" data-end="1732">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="1535" data-end="1732">To connect multiple projectors or displays, you might need an adapter or splitter, such as:</p>
<ul data-start="1733" data-end="1886">
<li data-start="1733" data-end="1761">
<p data-start="1735" data-end="1761"><strong data-start="1735" data-end="1759">Matrox TripleHead2Go</strong></p>
</li>
<li data-start="1762" data-end="1820">
<p data-start="1764" data-end="1820"><strong data-start="1764" data-end="1780">Datapath FX4</strong> (a more advanced and reliable option)</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1821" data-end="1886">
<p data-start="1823" data-end="1886"><strong data-start="1823" data-end="1857">StarTech multi-output adapters</strong> (affordable and practical)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1888" data-end="2083">Think of these devices as &ldquo;video multipliers&rdquo; that expand your available outputs.</p>
<div class="alert-banner-notes">
<p data-start="1888" data-end="2083">MadMapper supports&nbsp;<strong data-start="1991" data-end="2012">unlimited outputs</strong> with any license, the only limitation comes from your hardware setup.</p>
</div>
<h4>Windows Recommendations</h4>
<p class="p2">MadMapper runs equally well on Windows systems, as long as they&rsquo;re properly configured.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><strong>Processor (CPU)</strong>: Choose a recent, high-performance model (Intel i5/i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen series). Avoid entry-level CPUs, which can bottleneck performance.</li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Graphics Card (GPU)</strong>: A dedicated GPU is essential. NVIDIA and AMD cards are both supported.</li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Memory (RAM)</strong>: At least 8 GB is required; 16 GB or more is recommended for smooth performance.</li>
<li class="li2"><strong>Storage</strong>: An SSD drive is strongly recommended for faster project loading and video playback.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Even compact PCs such as Intel NUCs or mini PCs can handle projection mapping surprisingly well, it can be ideal for small or portable setups.</p>
