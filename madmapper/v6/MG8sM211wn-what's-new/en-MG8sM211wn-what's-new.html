<p class="p1">This landmark update introduces powerful new tools for artists and creatives to develop and experiment with their mapping ideas, perform more intuitively in live contexts, and synchronize entire shows with the brand-new <strong>Timeline</strong> feature. It&rsquo;s been one of the community&rsquo;s most requested additions, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to finally deliver it to the MAD family.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>MadMapper</strong>&rsquo;s interface has also received a refined visual overhaul. While everything remains where you expect it, the experience is cleaner, sharper, and more precise.
