<p class="p1">This landmark update introduces powerful new tools for creators to experiment with their mapping ideas, perform more intuitively in live contexts, and synchronize entire shows with the brand-new <strong>Timeline</strong> feature. It&rsquo;s been one of the most requested additions, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to finally deliver it to the MAD community.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>MadMapper</strong>&rsquo;s interface has also received a refined visual overhaul. While everything remains where you expect it, the experience is cleaner, sharper, and more precise. For a quick tour of what&rsquo;s new, explore the &ldquo;<a class="int-link" href="madmapper-v6-at-a-glance" data-page-suid="3hgIot1RBf">MadMapper 6 at a Glance</a>&rdquo; page.</p>
